Liri Node Application

This is a javascript application which will serve as a lanuage interpretation and recognition interface. It will run in node and will take inputted key words and return results from several API's depending on what is inputted. The function of this project, beyond the scope of providing me the developer with practice in learned skills as well as finding new things out, will be to provide a means for the user to acquire data regarding music venues, music and artist information, and also information regarding movies. 

Liri will consist of several axios blocks of code which will communicate with the appropriate API's to return data depending on the queries inputted by the user. In order for the app to determine what API to request data from there will need to be some conditional blocks into which the axios calls will be nested. Further nested inside of those calls to the API will be the blocks of code which will format the outgoing information heading back to the user, which will be displayed in the terminal for their view.
